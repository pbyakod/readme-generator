## Short Description

This project aims to help users generate quality README's with the help of node packages and javascript. Instead of spending hours on end detailing and designing your Github readme files, you can generate one in a matter of minutes - by just simply answering a set of pre-coded questions. 

## Instructions 

Before executing the program, clone the repository onto your local computer. Once complete, navigate to the repository on your command-line interference and enter the following command:

```
npm init -y
npm i inquirer
```

This allows you to download the neccesary node packages to run the program. After this is complete, enter the following node command to begin generating the README.md file:

```
node index.js
```

## Walkthrough Video

Below is a link to the walkthrough video, which demonstrates how the README.md generator works.
